# C Programming Practice Repository

Welcome to my C programming practice repository! Here, you'll find a collection of programs that I used to enhance my understanding of basic to advanced C programming concepts. These programs served as a revision tool for me as I worked on my final project, `pizzaproject.c`.

## About the Repository

This repository contains various C programs that cover a wide range of topics, from fundamental concepts to more complex techniques. Each program is designed to reinforce specific aspects of C programming and to help solidify my understanding of the language.

## Getting Started

To explore the programs in this repository, simply navigate through the directories and files. Each program is well-documented, providing explanations of the concepts being demonstrated and how they relate to `pizzaproject.c`.

## How to Use

Feel free to clone this repository and experiment with the programs on your local machine. You can compile and run each program to observe its behavior and understand the underlying principles. Additionally, you can modify the code and experiment with different scenarios to deepen your understanding.

## Contributions

If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional programs that you think would be beneficial to include in this repository, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated!
